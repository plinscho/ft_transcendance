Sure, let's walk through the steps of rendering the index.html page located in index.html when you navigate to localhost:8000.

1. Browser Request
You open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
2. Nginx Frontend Service
The request hits the Nginx server running in the frontend service as defined in the docker-compose.yaml file.
Nginx listens on port 80 and 443, but since you are accessing localhost:8000, it will be proxied to the appropriate backend service.
3. Nginx Configuration
The nginx.conf file in nginx.conf defines how Nginx handles incoming requests.
The configuration specifies that requests to the root (/) should serve the static files from /usr/share/nginx/html, where index.html is located.
4. Serving Static Files
Nginx serves the index.html file located in /usr/share/nginx/html (copied from index.html during the Docker build process).
5. Proxying API Requests
If the request was for an API endpoint (e.g., /api/), Nginx would proxy the request to the appropriate backend service (e.g., home_service or login_service).
The proxy configuration is defined in the nginx.conf file under the location /api/ block.
6. Backend Services
The backend services (home_service and login_service) are Django applications running in separate containers.
These services are connected to the PostgreSQL database (db service) as defined in their respective settings.py files.
7. Database Interaction
If the backend services need to interact with the PostgreSQL database, they use the database connection settings defined in their settings.py files.
The database service (db) is running in a separate container and is accessible to the backend services via the Docker network.
Summary of Steps:
Browser Request: Navigate to http://localhost:8000.
Nginx Frontend Service: Nginx receives the request.
Nginx Configuration: Nginx serves the index.html file from /usr/share/nginx/html.
Serving Static Files: The index.html file is rendered in the browser.
Proxying API Requests: If applicable, Nginx proxies API requests to backend services.
Backend Services: Backend services handle API requests and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
Database Interaction: Backend services query or update the PostgreSQL database as needed.
This flow ensures that static files are served by Nginx, while dynamic content and API requests are handled by the Django backend services, which interact with the PostgreSQL database.
