# DJANGO 

1. Start by running "django-admin startproject <project_name>"
2. To run the service, cd inside the project and run "python3 manage.py runserver"
3. Create apps with "python3 manage.py startapp <app_name>"

Each App has its own views and urls.
Views.py processes the resquests from the web, and it is mapped in the urls.py.
Later we have to configure the globals urls.py from the project

project/app/views.py:
    -   Take http requests and return a http response.

project/app/urls.py
    -   Executes de view. It can allocate multiple urls for different
        views, so it can redirect to a certain urls depending on the view.
